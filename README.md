# Hangman Game

This Hangman game was created as a school project when I was 14 years old using the Turing programming language. It allows users to play the classic word-guessing game where they need to guess letters to complete a hidden word before a man gets hanged. 

## Features

- Random selection of words from a provided word list.
- GUI interface with graphical representations of the hangman.
- Interactive gameplay that responds to user input.
- Tracking of correct and incorrect guesses.
- Win condition when the user guesses the word correctly.
- Resetting the game for a new round.

## How to Run

1. Install the Turing programming language.
2. Copy the code into a Turing IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the code.
4. Enjoy playing the Hangman game!

## Usage

- When prompted, enter a letter to make a guess.
- The game will display the current state of the word with blank spaces for unguessed letters.
- The hangman will progressively appear with each incorrect guess.
- Keep guessing until you either complete the word or the hangman is fully displayed.
- After the game ends, a new round will start automatically.

## Development

This Hangman game was created as a collaborative effort with a friend. We spent approximately 20 hours over the course of a school week writing and debugging the code to ensure the game functions correctly and responds to user interaction.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this Hangman game was developed using the Turing programming language and may require the installation of specific software to run. It is recommended to consult the Turing documentation for further assistance.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the game or experiment with new features!

Have fun playing Hangman!
